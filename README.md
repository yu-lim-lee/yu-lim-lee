# CREATIVE COMPUTING_ YU LIM LEE
## Thought on the field of computing



### Through this class, I had time to study creative computing on my own.

##### Thesedays, I know that it's to learn to code when we're young.
##### From this creative computing class, I learned that the scope of computing is wide and there are so many applicable fields.
##### Rather than just learning and memorizing skills, finding answers while thinking and producing different results depending on the value I entered seemed to be of great help to my creativity.

### Through this class, my interest in creative computing grew.While doing the research I found that it is possible to recognize my face through the program 
#### I had done dance club activities before. That's why I have a lot of videos of me dancing with my friends. But whenever I watch this video,
##### I always thought,  

#### _"I want to edit it with the effect that the camera seems only to take picture of me as an idol shooting."_

### However, I rarely knew how to apply it. This was an opportunity to implement it and I tried to produce it based on this video.

## Program (Python, OpenCV)

##### While investigating Creative computing, I learned of a program called Python and found that programs are commonly used to unlock cell phones with facial recognition.  Through this program, I could apply what I wanted to show.

##### However, I don’t know the reason yet, but I have failed. Mac is divided into an os system and an intel system, so it was a little difficult to find information. Next time, I will try Java, not Python. I will study the program more and succeed based on this video.

## Through experiment, I learned that filters that are popular in short forms such as Instagram and TikTok these days are also produced in this way.

# The difference between facial coding and facial recognition

+ Facial detection 
##### technology to detect the position of the face (simple face appearance)
  + Facial coding
  ##### Face expression recognition - measures human emotions (face muscles such as corners of the mouth, eyebrows, etc.)
   + Facial recognition
   ##### Facial characteristics
   
# Program (spark AR studio)
#### I tried to make a face filter through face recognition.   While investigating creative computing, I learned that facial recognition was also a result of the computing program.
#### I conducted an experiment in which the movement of the face is detected, and the filter is applied automatically through the program.

### Even though It was my first time working on creative computing, it was interesting to do researches and experiment alone.

### Hope to learn more deeply about creative computing, which is essential to everyone thesedays.

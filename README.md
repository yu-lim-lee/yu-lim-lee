# CREATIVE COMPUTING_ YU LIM LEE
## Thought on the field of computing

_intro_


# Through this class, I had time to study creative computing on my own.

### Thesedays, I know that it's to learn to code when we're young.
### From this creative computing class, I learned that the scope of computing is wide and there are so many applicable fields.
### Rather than just learning and memorizing skills, finding answers while thinking and producing different results depending on the value I entered seemed to be of great help to my creativity.
